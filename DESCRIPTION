Description: Performs k-means-like clustering, where each mean is a thin plate
    spline fit via mgcv::bam() to combined points of trajectories in each
    cluster. Each trajectory's distance to a spline mean is mean squared loss
    across its points. All trajectories have the same time units, can be
    unequally spaced and have unequal number of observations, and are aligned
    at time 0.
