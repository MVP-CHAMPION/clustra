Description: Clusters medical trajectories (unequally spaced and unequal 
    lengths) aligned by an intervention time. Performs k-means clustering,
    where each mean is a thin plate spline fit to all points in a cluster. 
    Distance is MSE across trajectory points to cluster spline. Provides
    silhouette plots and Adjusted Rand Index evaluations of the number of
    clusters. Scales well to large data with multicore parallelism available
    to speed computation.
