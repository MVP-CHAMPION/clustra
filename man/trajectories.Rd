\arguments{
\item{data}{Data table or data frame with response measurements, one per observation.
Column names are \code{id}, \code{time}, \code{response}, \code{group}. Note that
\code{id}s must be sequential starting from 1. This affects expanding group
numbers to \code{id}s.}

\item{k}{Number of clusters (groups)}

\item{group}{Vector of initial group numbers corresponding to \code{id}s.}

\item{maxdf}{Integer. Basis dimension of smooth term. See \code{\link[mgcv]{s}} function
parameter \code{k}, in package \code{mgcv}.}

\item{conv}{A vector of length two, \code{c(iter, minchange)}, where \code{iter} is the maximum
number of EM iterations and \code{minchange} is the minimum percentage of subjects
changing group to continue iterations. Setting \code{minchange} to zero continues
iterations until no more changes occur or \code{maxiter} is reached.}

\item{mccores}{Integer number of cores to use by \code{mclapply} sections. Parallelization is
over \code{k}, the number of clusters.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to produce debug output. A value > 1 will plot tps fit lines
in each iteration.}

\item{...}{See \code{\link{clustra}} for allowed \code{...} parameters.}
}
\value{
A list with components
\itemize{
\item \code{deviance} - The final deviance in each cluster added across clusters.
\item \code{group} - Integer vector of group assignments corresponding to unique \code{id}s.
\item \code{loss} - Numeric matrix with rows corresponding to unique \code{id}s and one
column for each cluster. Each entry is the mean squared loss for the data in
the \code{id} relative to the cluster model.
\item \code{k} - An integer giving the requested number of clusters.
\item \code{k_cl} - An integer giving the converged number of clusters. Can be
smaller than \code{k} when some clusters become too small for degrees of freedom
during convergence.
\item \code{data_group} - An integer vector, giving group assignment as expanded into
all \code{id} time points.
\item \code{tps} - A list with \code{k_cl} elements, each an object returned by the
\code{mgcv::bam} fit of a cluster thin plate spline model.
\item \code{iterations} - An integer giving the number of iterations taken.
\item \code{counts} - An integer vector giving the number of \code{id}s in each cluster.
\item \code{counts_df} - An integer vector giving the total number of observations in
each cluster (sum of the number of observations for \code{id}s belonging to the
cluster).
\item \code{changes} - An integer, giving the number of \code{id}s that changed clusters in
the last iteration. This is zero if converged.

\description{
Performs k-means clustering on continuous \code{response} measured over \code{time},
where each mean is defined by a thin plate spline fit to all points in a
cluster. Typically, this function is called by \code{\link{clustra}}.
